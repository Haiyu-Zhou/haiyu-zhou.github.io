            Flowers of Fire: Illustrations from Japanese Fireworks Catalogues

            The spinning saxon, flying pigeons, polka batteries, jumping jacks
            and firecrackers, squibs and salutes, Aztec Fountains, Bengal
            Lights, and Egyptian Circlets, bangers or bungers, cakes,
            crossettes, candles, and a Japanese design known as kamuro (boys
            haircut), which looks like a bobbed wig teased out across the
            stratosphere. . . the language of fireworks has a richness that
            hints at the explosive payload it references. And yet, anyone who
            has ever held their camera up to the blazing sky knows that a
            brilliant firework show can rarely be captured to any satisfying
            degree. Perhaps this is what makes a nineteenth-century series of
            catalogue advertisements for Japanese fireworks so mesmerizing:
            denied the expectations of photorealism, these images are free to
            evoke a unique sense of visual wonder.

            Thought to have been invented in China around the second century
            BCE, fireworks began as modest bamboo sparklers, advancing toward
            today’s complex pyrotechnic spectacles with the piecemeal discovery
            of saltpeter, gunpowder, tubular projectiles, and colorizing salts.
            While Chinese and European firework histories are heavily
            documented, Japan’s traditions remain moderately more obscure.
            Despite excellent pyrotechnic craftsmanship, for example, it was
            still possible for researchers to write, as recently as 2010, that
            “comprehensive information encompassing the development of fireworks
            culture in Japan, the history, and any intricate symbolism, is not
            widely known or appreciated within Japan, let alone abroad.”

            Fireworks appeared in Japan sometime around 1600 and were called
            hanabi — a combination of the kanji “fire” and “flower”. Japanese
            innovations have been responsible for a pair of popular firework
            forms: peonies and chrysanthemums, two subcategories of the larger
            class of warimono designs. Excellence in craftsmanship arose from
            competition in nineteenth-century Edo between hanabishi (firework
            artisans) on either side of Ryōgoku Bridge. As the story is told,
            passersby would shout Kayiga or Tamaya — the names of the rival
            master craftsmen — and these names are still shouted during
            fireworks events in the area today. The rivalry lasted until 1843,
            when an explosion in the Tamaya shop led to the expulsion of the
            business from Edo.

            The illustrations below come from catalogues digitized by the
            Yokohama City Library, which contain English-language advertisements
            for Hirayama Fireworks and Yokoi Fireworks, published by C. T. Brock
            and Company, the oldest fireworks manufacturer in the United
            Kingdom. Founded in 1877, the Hirayama company was global from its
            onset: the founder Jinta Hirayama is thought to have been the first
            Japanese citizen to register a U.S. copyright.

            Of the many intriguing images in these catalogues, it is their
            inclusion of complex figures, which seem pyrotechnically impossible,
            that most captivates the contemporary eye. To understand these
            scintillating and unfamiliar forms (daylight bombshells, parachute
            light-balls), it is helpful to go back into the annals of a British
            fireworks dynasty. Pyrotechnics: The History and Art of Firework
            Making (1922) is written by a man “the eighth generation of a family
            of pyrotechnists”: Alan St. Hill Brock, a descendent of John Brock,
            who founded Brock’s Fireworks Ltd in 1698, publisher of the
            catalogues under question and still in existence today. According to
            Brock the author, daylight fireworks originated in Japan and were
            not really “fireworks” as we have come to know them. Instead of
            pyrotechnic effects, the daylight projectile contained “a grotesque
            balloon in the form of an animal, human figure, or other form,
            which, being open and weighted at the lower end, becomes inflated as
            it falls and remains in the air for a considerable period.” In the
            catalogue images gathered here, you will see daylight balloons
            shaped like frogs, mounted jockeys, and a tortoise-riding fisherman
            (probably the fairytale protagonist Urashima Tarō, on a journey to
            the submarine Dragon Palace).
