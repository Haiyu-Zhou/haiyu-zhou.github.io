		<h1>PUCD 2126<br />Assignment 1: Review and Experience Questionnaire</h1>

		<h2>Core 1 Interaction Review and Experience Questionnaire </h2>

		<h3>Fill out the following questionnaire to the best of your ability.</h3>

		<div>
			<p>1. Do you have an previous experience with coding? Which classes have you already taken that explored
				HTML/CSS or Javascript? </p>
			<div>
				<!-- answer goes here -->
				<p>
					Yes, I have taken the Core 1 Interaction last semester. We learned a little about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>2. If you have worked with code in the past, what parts of it made sense to you? Which parts were
				exciting?</p>
			<div>
				<!-- answer goes here -->
				<p>
					I think code is a language that's totally new to me, even after Learning it for a whole semester. And this is also the most exciting part of coding for me, because I can always learn new things in it, new codes, new functions and so on.
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>3. If you have worked with code in the past, which parts were the most confusing? What were the least
				interesting? </p>
			<div>
				<!-- answer goes here -->
				<p>During last semester, I found it too hard for me to combine codes (the numbers, letters) with what they would visually look like in the websites in my mind, and I also found it hard to express what I want the website to be through coding. The gaps between my ideas and my results always upset me.</p>
			</div>

			<p>4. Do you have any anxieties around coding, or learning to code? Is there anything I can do to help
				alleviate those anxieties in this class? </p>
			<div>
				<!-- answer goes here -->
				<p>I get anxious when I found my websites are not visually and functionally good as the ones that made by my classmates, since we are studying in the same class but I couldn't do as well as most of my classmates do. This was what I felt during the last semester, but I think I'll try to change my mindset a little bit.</p>

			</div>

			<p>5. In your own words, can you describe at a high level how the internet works? </p>
			<div>
				<!-- answer goes here -->
				<p>As I got to know about the formation of the internet from the lectures, I believe that the internet is the system that connects multiple portals, through which information can be transferred. It could be as small-sized as the local internet system between the few colleges, or has a coverage as big as the whole world.</p>
			</div>

			<p>6. What is the difference between a webpage, a website, and a web server?</p>
			<div>
				<!-- answer goes here -->
				<p>I think a webpage could be one page in a website, while a website can have several webpages. And a website is a platform that carries information, and it exists in a web server.</p>
			</div>

			<p>7. In your own words, what is HTML?</p>
			<div>
				<!-- answer goes here -->
				<p>HTML is a coding language used to compose the basic structure of a website.</p>
			</div>

			<p>8. Using the 6 levels of HTML Heading elements, list your 6 favorite songs in order from most, to
				least, favorite.</p>
			<div>
				<!-- headings go here -->
				<h1>勿忘(WASURENA)</h1>
				<h2>1984</h2>
				<h3>夏夜晚风</h3>
				<h4>恋</h4>
				<h5>Lover Boy 88</h5>
				<h6>Funny Bunny</h6>

			</div>

			<p>9. Choosing a quote from an author you appreciate, use the Paragraph HTML element to display it, and
				use the inline Bold and Italic elements to add emphasis to certain parts of the quotation.</p>
			<div>
				<!-- quotation goes here -->
				<p>"I do not say that <em>John</em> or <em>Jonathan</em> will realize all this; but such is the character of that morrow which mere lapse of time can never make to dawn. The light which puts out our eyes is darkness to us. Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn. <b>The sun is but a morning star.</b>"</p>
				<p>Henry David Thoreau <em>Walden and Civil Disobedience</em></p>

					"Traditional MUDs implement a role-playing video game set in a fantasy world populated by
					fictional characters, with players choosing classes in order to gain specific skills or
					powers. The objective of this sort of game is to slay monsters, explore a fantasy world,
					complete quests, go on adventures, create a story by roleplaying, and advance the created
					character. Many MUDs were fashioned around the dice-rolling rules of the Dungeons & Dragons
					series of games."

					to purchase virtual items, while others charge a monthly subscription fee. MUDs can be accessed

					userexperience. Numerous games are listed at various web portals, such as The Mud Connector."
