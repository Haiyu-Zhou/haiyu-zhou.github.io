      <p>On Beginnings</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Beginnings and endings: In real life: beginnings equals endings; In poems: No endings.</li>
        <li>The beginning of a poem as a fallen fruit.</li>
        <li>The beginning of a poem is ideas, not the words.</li>
        <li>"a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice" - I love this scene. It feels like the most irrelevant environment for poems. But poems are there for no reason.</li>
        <li>"If you have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a dead-end alley, at the top of a cliff you haven't even climbed." I think this is the same for all art.</li>
        <li>We each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime, but with a lot of semicolons. - poems as the semicolon</li>
        <li>"The End" - As a celebration of something big. But also a sense of loss.</li>
        <li>Poems are always flying, flowing in the air, and that's why I like poems.</li>
        <li>Poem itself is the consequence of its origin (The ideas).</li>
        <li>"Memoryâ€™s fog is rising." - so beautiful</li>
